# Development Server
To get a development version of the app running follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run "rails server"
3. Run "rake db:seed"

# Production Server
To get a development version of the app running follow the steps below:

1. Log onto Digital ocean and spin up a server with Ubuntu 14.04 x 64
2. Install Ruby and rbenv according to [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-14-04)
3. Configure the server with Unicorn and Nginx according to [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-rails-app-with-unicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04)
  - The only divergence from the tutorial is that you need to point the root in your Nginx configuration to "/public/current" instead of "/public" for Capistrano
4. Follow [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04) to get SSL working with LetsEncrypt
5. Make sure that you have SECRET_KEY_BASE set and RAILS_ENV=production in your .rbenv-vars file in the root of the app
6. Change the server settings in the "/config/deploy/production.rb" file to your server's IP and a user with sudo capability
7. Run "bundle exec cap production deploy:inital"
8. SSH into your server and run "rake db:seed" 
9. Navigate to your server's IP in the browser to use the blog app!
